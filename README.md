# MLB-Pitchers-and-Climate-Impact

In this project, I analyze the statistics of United States-born MLB pitchers from 2010 through 2019 to determine if the climate of their home states and playing in these climates has any impact on their arms and their MLB workload.

The data for this project is obtained through an SQL query run on the Sean Lahman baseball database, with the temperature information being scraped from the site usa.com.
